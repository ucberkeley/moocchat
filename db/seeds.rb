q1 = Question.create! :text=>"Wolves can double their numbers every year. They do not do so, however, if the area in which they live is already full and the territory of each pack borders on the territory of other packs on all sides. Lone wolves, unable to establish a territory near their place of origin, disperse to a less desirable habitat and often are hunted by people. Which of the following conclusions may be properly drawn from the information in the passage above?", :answers => ["The number of wolves in any area suitable for wolves may be predicted to quadruple in two years.", "Wolves are ejected from the pack to wander singly as lone wolves when the number of wolves in the pack has doubled.", "The amount of territory suitable for wolves has been diminishing in recent years as a result of human encroachment, with a resulting diminution in the wolf population.", "Wolf hunting can continue at a moderate rate on the fringes of a good habitat for wolves without a decrease in the average yearly wolf population in that territory.", "The wolf population density in a given area of wolf territory does not vary with the yearly rate of wolf reproduction."], :correct_answer_index => 3
Question.create(text:"The TJ-700 and the Beta Turbomax are two models of cars of different manufacturers.  These two models have almost identical specifications and features, and they sell for almost the same price. Both were introduced on the market five years ago, and each year, the respective manufacturers spend about the same amount in advertising. In the past five years, the total number of TJ-700's sold is about 80% greater than the total number of Beta Turbomax's sold. Clearly, the advertising firm that created TJ-700 ads created much more effective ads than the firm that created Beta Turbomax ads.

Question.create(text:"Epidemiologist: Malaria passes into the human population when a mosquito carrying the virus bites a human who has no immunity. The malaria parasite can remain for up to forty days in the blood of an infected person. The disease cannot be passed from person to person, unless a non-infected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person. Theoretically, malaria could be eradicated in any given area, if all the mosquitoes carrying malaria in that area are exterminated. If such a course of action is carried out at a worldwide level, then the global eradication of malaria is possible. Which of the following, if true, suggests that the epidemiologist’s plan for eliminating malaria is not viable?",answers: ["A person who is infected with malaria can infect a mosquito that is not carrying malaria, if that mosquito bites such a person.", "Unless a mosquito bites an infected person, and then bites a non-infected person, malaria cannot be passed directly from human to human.", "Malaria is still endemic in many parts of the world, and many health workers believe that the global eradication of malaria is not possible.", "Some people in areas where malaria is rife have developed an immunity to mosquitos, yet they are also show a higher incidence of genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anemia.", "Mosquitos in many developing parts of the world are responsible for passing on a variety of viruses to human hosts."],correct_answer_index: 0)

Since the advent of file sharing, however, music CD sales have actually risen; therefore, file sharing does not hurt the music business. In fact, file sharing seems to have had a positive effect on the music industry. The argument above is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",answers: ["is a circular argument, assuming what the argument sets out to prove", "defies common sense, since people will not pay for music they can acquire for free", "fails to specify how much music CD sales have risen since the advent of file sharing", "assumes a causal relationship between variables with a high correlation without examining other potential factors", "denies the legitimacy of a claim on the basis of the bias interest of those (music industry representatives) making the claim"],correct_answer_index: 3)

In formulating this clinical study the scientist divided 100 smokers into two groups of 50 each. Members of group A were given a piece of chocolate every time they wanted a cigarette. Group B members were given a piece of gum every time they wanted a cigarette. At the end of the experiment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of success at quitting smoking. Accordingly, the scientist concluded that chocolate does not help people quit smoking. Which of the following is the most effective criticism of the results of the experiment?",answers: ["The scientist should have used a larger population of smokers from which to draw the sample.", "The scientist should have extended the clinical studies to better assess the long-term effects of the experiment.", "The scientist should have instead concluded that chocolate does not help people quit smoking any more than gum helps people quit smoking.", "The scientist should have given the subjects their choice of candy and gum to factor in personal preferences.", "The scientist should not have substituted one oral habit for another, which may have introduced a clinical bias."],correct_answer_index: 2)
Question.create(text:"Prof. Hernandez's monumental work The History of Central America covers everything about the region from the origin of the Mesoamerican period to the end of the Cold War.  While the book has several informative maps and charts, many of the chapters spend less time describing facts and more time explaining Prof. Hernandez's theories.  Indeed, the last two chapters consist exclusively of his exposition of theory of the role of Central America in post WWII world politics.

This high rate of egg failure also holds true for hawks and owls. Ornithologists have long hypothesized that this problem among birds of prey may be due to pesticide traces left in their food supply. Which of the following statements about birds of prey would most likely tend to confirm the ornithologists’ hypothesis?",answers: ["The egg failure rate for birds of prey in pesticide-free wilderness areas is the same as for non predatory birds in the same areas.", "High egg failure rate is common among all endangered birds.", "Because birds of prey eat carrion, it is difficult to predict the exact contents of their diet.", "The egg failure rate for non predatory birds is slightly higher in cultivated areas than in wilderness areas.", "No significant difference in pesticide sensitivity has been found between eagles and hawks."],correct_answer_index: 0)
Question.create(text:"Due to an easing of state sanctions against hunting, Deersdale Preserve has experienced an influx of hunters in the last several months. During this time, the silvertail fox, a popular target for hunters, has seen a marked decrease in population.  Therefore, to prevent the population of silvertail fox—an important apex predator responsible for keeping the Deersdale County’s rabbit population in check—from falling even lower, the state should once again place strict sanctions against hunting.Which of the following, if true, may suggest that stricter sanctions against hunting would not have the desired effect?",answers: ["The population of rabbits has surged ever since the hunting sanctions in Deersdale County were lifted.","The silvertail fox population varies greatly throughout the year, especially during winter when prey becomes scarce.", "The local authorities are expecting even more hunters in the coming year to arrive to the park.","The silvertail fox had been experiencing a population surge shortly before the state sanctions against hunting were eased.","The grey wolf, a large predator that competes with the silvertail fox over Deersdale Preserve’s rabbit population, has seen its numbers decrease since the arrival of the hunters."],correct_answer_index: 1)
Question.create(text: "The rate of health complications of patients on intravenous (IV) therapy at a particular hospital was higher than usual. Government inspectors found that the typical IV solutions used in this hospital had somewhat high concentrations of sodium and potassium, which were raising patients' blood pressure and taxing their kidneys. The government inspectors mandated lowering the sodium and potassium in these IV preparations, and threatened with a possible government fine.  In compliance, the hospital lowered the sodium and potassium levels in the IV solutions to the correct levels.  Nevertheless, patients on IV therapy at that hospital continued to have a high rate of health complications. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why acting on the government inspectors' recommendations failed to achieve its goal?",answers: ["The change in IV solution procedure meant a number of related legal documents had to be renegotiated and rewritten, at great cost.","When sodium and potassium levels in the blood fall below their baseline level, it can damage cells throughout the body by reverse osmosis.","It is typical for a patient's appetite to increase to healthy levels once they have completed a course of IV therapy.", "A high proportion of patients at this hospital are older, and older patients are more vulnerable to infections that can accompany IVs.", "Because the findings were published in the news, some patients have chosen to use another hospital in the region."],correct_answer_index: 3, explanation: "TO BE DETERMINED")
