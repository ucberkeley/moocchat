<h1>User Guide for the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools v1.3.1</h1>
<p>
  The Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools are a set of command line interfaces that allow you to easily build solutions leveraging Amazon Mechanical Turk without writing a line of code.  The goals of the Command Line Tools are to:
  <ul>
    <li>To abstract you from the "muck" of using web services</li>
    <li>To allow you to create solutions without writing a single line of code</li>
    <li>To allow you to focus more on solving the business problem and less on managing technical details</li>
  </ul>
</p>

The Command Line Tools can be run on the following environments:
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
  <li>Unix based system (i.e. Mac OSX, Linux, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<a name="whatsnew"/>

<a name="installation"/>
<h2>Installing the Command Line Tools</h2>
The installation of the Command Line Tools and other required components is simple and requires minimal configuration.<p/>
<p/>
If you downloaded and ran the mech-turk-setup.exe file, you have installed and configured the Command Line Tools. When this documentation refers to [Command Line Tools Installation Directory], it assumes the following directory structure:<br/> Directory] is <span class="programlisting">[Command Line Tools Installation Directory] = mech-turk-tools-1.3.1</span>
<p/>
  If you downloaded a different file, use the following instructions to install and configure the Command Line Tools.
</p>
The instructions below assume that the downloaded file was uncompressed in a directory that you specified.  When the instructions refer to [Command Line Tools Installation Directory], it assumes the following directory structure:<br/>
<span class="programlisting">[Command Line Tools Installation Directory] = [The directory that the downloaded file was uncompressed into]\aws-mturk-clt-1.3.1</span>


<ol>
  <li>Sign up for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account at the <a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html" target="_blank">AWS web site</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign up for an Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester account at the <a href="http://requester.mturk.com" target="_blank">Requester web site</a>.</li>
  <li>Configure the Command Line Tools to use your <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mturk/tools/pages/aws-access-identifiers/aws-identifier.html" target="_blank">AWS access identifiers</a> information.<p/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Open the following file:
  <span class="programlisting">
    [Command Line Tools Installation Directory]\bin\mturk.properties
  </span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Set the following properties to reflect your <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mturk/tools/pages/aws-access-identifiers/aws-identifier.html" target="_blank">AWS access identifiers</a>:<p/>
<span class="programlisting">
  access_key=[Your AWS Access Key]<br/>
  secret_key=[Your Secret Key]
</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Save and close the file.</li>
  <li>If you downloaded the Unix distribution, you must set the MTURK_CMD_HOME environment variable to point to your Command Line Tools installation location.</li>
  <li>If you downloaded the Unix distribution, you must set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your Java Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) installation location.</li>
</ol>


For advanced users, you can optionally set the MTURK_CMD_HOME environment variable to point to your Command Line Tools installation location so that they can be run from any directory.<p/>
Note: If you did not download a version of the Command Line Tools that contains the Java Standard Edition Runtime Environment (Only available for Windows distribution), you must have the Java JRE 1.5.X (JRE 5).  The Command Line Tools are not 100% compatible with JRE 6.  You can download the JRE at the following website: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp</a>.<p/>

If you have installed the JRE and elect not to use the included JRE (Windows distribution only), you should set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JRE installation.

<a name="sandbox"/>
<h2>Using the Amazon Mechanical Turk Developer Sandbox for Testing</h2>

By default, the Command Line Tools are configured to work against the production site (<a href="http://www.mturk.com" target="_blank">http://www.mturk.com</a>).  When creating HITs on the Production site, you will need to have a funded Amazon Mechanical Turk account. Visit the following link to fund your account: <a href=" http://requester.mturk.com/mturk/youraccount" target="_blank"> http://requester.mturk.com/mturk/youraccount</a>.<p/>

Optionally, you can configure the Command Line tools to work against the Developer Sandbox environment.  The Developer Sandbox is a simulated environment that allows developers to test their Amazon Mechanical Turk solutions for free.  To view HITs created in the sandbox, go to the Developer Sandbox worker site (<a href="http://workersandbox.mturk.com" target="_blank"> http://workersandbox.mturk.com</a>).<p/>

To configure the Command Line Tools to work against the Developer Sandbox:
<ol>
  <li>Open the following file in a text editor:<br/>
    <span class="programlisting">[Command Line Tools Installation Directory]\bin\mturk.properties</span></li>
  <li>Comment out the Production site service_url with a "#":<br/>
    <span class="programlisting">#service_url=http://mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com/?Service=AWSMechanicalTurkRequester</span></li>
  <li>Uncomment the Developer Sandbox service_url by removing the "#":<br/>
    <span class="programlisting">service_url=http://mechanicalturk.sandbox.amazonaws.com/?Service=AWSMechanicalTurkRequester</span></li>
  <li>Save and close the file.</li>
</ol>

You can also temporarily override your configuration in your mturk.properties file and work against the Developer Sandbox by using the -sandbox parameter with any of the commands.  For example: <p/>

<span class="programlisting"> loadHITs -sandbox [other options] </span>

This will execute the loadHITs command against the Developer Sandbox environment even if you have configured your command line tools to run against production in your mturk.properties file. <p/>

<a name="overviewsamples"/>
<h2>Overview of the Sample Applications</h2>
The Command Line Tools include a set of sample applications that demonstrate various use cases of Amazon Mechanical Turk.<p/>
There are 4 create HIT sample applications and 7 Qualification related sample applications.<p/>
Each create HIT sample application is defined by 3 files:
<ul>
  <li>Input File - A file containing the variable data to be placed in the HIT.  This is a tab-delimited text file.</li>
  <li>Question Template File - A file containing the template of the question that contains placeholders for the fields defined in the input file.  This is an XML file that conforms to the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSMechanicalTurkRequester/2007-06-21/ApiReference_QuestionFormDataStructureArticle.html" target="_blank">QuestionForm</a> schema.</li>
  <li>HIT Properties File - A file containing the desired properties for the HIT (i.e. title, description, etc.)</li>
</ul>

Each create HIT sample described in subsequent sections consist of the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>For each row in the Input File, the fields will be inserted into the placeholders of the Question Template File and the HIT will be created in the <a href="http://www.mturk.com" target="_blank">production site</a> with the properties defined in the HIT Properties File.  The # of rows in the Input File will determine how many HITs will be created.</li>
  <li>A Success File is generated containing identifiers to the HITs that were created.</li>
  <li>The HITs are accepted, worked on and submitted on the <a href="http://workersandbox.mturk.com" target="_blank">Worker sandbox site</a>.</li>
  <li>The Success File is used to retrieve the results of the HITs which are then written to a Results File.</li>
  <li>The Success File is then used to automatically approve all the HITs and then properly dispose of them.</li>
</ol>



Details on the Qualification related sample applications can be found in their respective section.<p/>
For more details on the above files, see section <a href="#filedescriptions">Description of Files Used by the Command Line Tools</a>.<p/>

<p>
 When you run GetResults multiple times in the same directory, the latest .results file will override the .results file from the previous GetResults run.
</p>
<p>
  Each HIT in this file has a link to your <strong>Manage HITs</strong> page in the <a href="http://requester.mturk.com" target="_blank">Requester web site</a>.</li>. Use these links if you want to manually reject assignments, pay bonuses, or send emails to Workers.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Note:</strong> When a HIT has multiple questions for each assignment, each answer is returned in its own column, rather than the old format of a comma separate list of answers unless you specify the -namevaluepair parameter.
</p>
<p>
  This operation returns metrics for the results in the file. These metrics show:
  <ul>
		<li>The number and percentage of assignments completed</li>
		<li>Elapsed time
		  <ul>
			 <li>If HITs are still being worked on, this is (current time - time HITs were loaded.)</li>
			 <li>If all HITs are complete, this is (the time the last assignment was submitted - time HITs were loaded.)</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Average time to submit per assignment</li>
	</ul>
	You will see output similar to the following on the screen.<br/>
  <span class="programlisting">Results have been written to file '..\samples\site_filter\site_filter.results'.<br/>
        Assignments completed: 30/30 (100%)<br/>

<h2>Running the Evaluate Qualification Requests Operation</h2>
This operation evaluates the answers submitted by Workers in order to approve/reject Qualification requests.<p/>

This operation uses an answer key file for the Qualification test to automatically review the test results submitted by Workers and determine if the Qualification request should be approved or rejected.  This method allows you to specify free text answers that can be automatically processed.  This overcomes a current limitation of the Amazon Mechanical Turk system where FreeTextAnswer type answers cannot be auto graded.<p/>

All questions must be answered correctly in order for the Qualification request to be approved.  A Qualification score of 100 will be assigned for approvals.<p/>

<h2>Running the Make Template Operation</h2>
This operation creates a copy of a sample applciation. After you run the sample applications that the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools provide, you might want to create your own application, probably one that is similar to one of the sample applications. The Make Template operation makes it easy for you to replicate one of the samples in a different directory. You can make a template of a HIT-generating sample, such as the Hello World sample or the Best Image sample. For these templates, run the Make Template operation from the [Command Line Tools installation directory]\hits directory.<p/>

You can also make copies of a Qualification sample by running the Make Template operation from the [Command Line Tools installation directory]\qualifications directory.<p/>

To run the Make Template operation:
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the following directory:<br/>
  <span class="programlisting">[Command Line Tools installation directory]\hits</span>
  or to the following directory:
  <span class="programlisting">[Command Line Tools installation directory]\qualifications</span>

 <p>
 When you run this operation for HIT-generating samples, the Command Line Tools creates the new directory and copies the .input, .question, and .properties files from the specified sample. These files are created with the name specified in the -target option. 
 If you are using Windows, the Command Line Tools creates new run.cmd, getResults.cmd, and approveAndDeleteResults.cmd 
 files. If you are using Unix, the new files are run.sh, getResults.sh, and approveAndDeleteResults.sh.
</p>

<h3>Options for MakeTemplate for Qualifications</h3>

When you run the makeTemplate command for qualifications, you can simply pass in the name of the target directory, e.g. makeTemplate myQual.  The makeTemplate command for qualifications only copies over one sample qualification unlike the makeTemplate for HITs operation.

<p>
 When you run this operation for Qualification-generating samples, the Command Line Tools creates the new directory and copies 
 the .answer, .question, and .properties files from the specified sample. These files are created with the name of the target directory you specified. If you are using Windows, the Command Line Tools creates new createQualification.cmd, updateQualification.cmd, 
 and deactivateQualification.cmd files. If you are using Unix, the new files are createQualification.sh, updateQualification.sh, and 
 deactivateQualification.sh.

<a name="logging"/>
<h2>Logging and Debugging</h2>
By default, logging has been enabled for all operations performed by the Command Line Tools.  The logs will contain significant details on each web request made to Amazon Mechanical Turk as well as details on the responses received back from the system.<p/>

These logs can be helpful in troubleshooting any issues you encounter with the Command Line Tools and contains sufficient details to allow us to diagnose them.<p/>

You can access the logs here:
<span class="programlisting">
[Command Line Tools Installation Directory]\log\java-aws-mturk.log
</span>
Since this file currently logs all requests, it will grow in size very quickly.  You can safely delete this file and not impact the functionality of the Command Line Tools.</p>
The logs are configured to only take up a maximum of 10 MB.  When a log file exceeds 2 MB, another log file is created (i.e. java-aws-mturk.2.log) up to 5 log files.  Once the maximum of 10 MB is reached, the first log file will be overwritten and will continue as a rolling process.<p/>

For advanced users, the level of logging can be specified.  To set the level of logging:
<ol>
  <li>Open your <strong>mturk.properties</strong> in a text editor.</li>
  <li>Add the following line as a property in the file:<br/>
  <span class="programlisting">log_level=[your desired log level]</span></li>
  <li>Save and close the file.</li>
</ol>

The Command Line Tools uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html" target="_blank">Log4J</a> for logging.  The following log level definitions are available:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>ALL</li>
  <li>FATAL</li>
  <li>ERROR</li>
  <li>WARN</li>
  <li>INFO</li>
  <li>DEBUG</li>
  <li>OFF</li>
</ul>

For more information on what details are logged for each log level, access the Log4J documentation on <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/index.html" target="_blank">log levels</a>.

<a name="portability"/>
<h2>Portability of Convenience Files</h2>
In general, the convenience files (i.e. mturk.properties, input files, question template, HIT template, etc.) used by the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line tools are portable to the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java.<p/>
However, the convenience files are not currently portable to other Amazon Mechanical Turk SDKs in other programming languages (i.e. Ruby, C#, PERL, etc.).<p/>
Portability across SDKs on different programming platforms is a desired goal for future releases.
